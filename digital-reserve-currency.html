                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>“Could a digital‑only currency replace the US dollar as the world’s
reserve currency?”
For decades, the USD has dominated global financial markets, so many countries hold
dollars as part of their foreign exchange reserves. Countries keep foreign currency reserves
as it protects them from “economic shocks” (www.tutor2u.net). Therefore, the country can
maintain a stable financial market and prevent it from collapsing easily. Due to the rapid
growth of digital-only currencies such as Bitcoin and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)
growing rapidly, this has prompted speculation about the future of currencies and trading will
change from the traditional USD to the latest cryptocurrencies (Team, 2025; Digital &
Analogue Partners, 2025). Tension between countries grows as they discuss the future of
the world's currency reserves. A small yet growing number of countries are keen on pursuing
digital-only currencies as the successor to the US Dollar; others are not so keen yet
(J.P.Morgan, 2024). Some countries may want to change from having reserves in the US
dollar, as it can be influenced by external factors such as social media sentiment, by creating
a changing level of confidence in investors, which in turn also impacts interest rates
(Ox.ac.uk, 2025). Although digital currencies are growing rapidly, I think that it is unlikely to
be adopted by the whole world, as every nation would have to agree to use cryptocurrencies
as a means of trade and reserve. Additionally, this may raise people’s concerns around trust
and the long-term stability of cryptocurrencies (Chen, 2024). The USD is a fiat currency; its
value is derived from government authority rather than being backed by gold, which is known
as the gold standard (Best, 2024).
Before the Second World War, the US was a major weapons producer (Milliken, 2025). They
traded with their allies, accepting gold as payment. Due to many countries depleting their
gold supplies during the war, they did not have enough gold to back their currencies. Many
countries depleted their gold reserves during the war and could not return to the gold
standard afterwards(Best, 2024). Therefore, 44 delegates from allied countries met in 1944
at Bretton Woods to create a system to improve the
foreign exchange, which benefits all countries
(Arslanalp, Eichengreen & Simpson-Bell, 2024). This
led the USD to become the reserve currency of many
countries. This made the USD the main reserve
currency. As the USD was so widely used, countries
and companies had a greater incentive to adopt the use
of the USD during trade, reinforced by the fact that the
US has active financial markets, so countries could hold
bonds in markets such as the US treasuries (Conway,
2024). Therefore, leading to greater trust in the USD,
making it the main currency in global reserves, as
shown by the IMF’s graph, the USD makes up about
58% of the total foreign official reserves (Arslanalp,
Eichengreen & Simpson-Bell, 2024). The US’s dominant
political and military actions also reinforce the
confidence that investors have in the USD. Its contributions to the IMF (International
Monetary Fund) can help to persuade countries to invest in USD. Similar effects are
achieved when strategic commodity pricing strategies are used to keep demand high.
Digital currencies are a form of money that can only be used and traded on a digital network,
rather than in physical form, such as coins and bills (Natwest.com, 2023). Cryptocurrencies
can be fully decentralised or could be backed by CBDCs. If a digital currency is
decentralised, then it’s not affected by any single government or bank (Bank of England,
2023). Each type has different impacts on the global financial system. Bitcoin is one of the
most decentralised digital currencies (Team, 2025).
Most cryptocurrencies operate on blockchain technology, a shared digital record of
transactions that is managed by many computer systems rather than a single bank. They are
difficult for governments to control, which makes them a good alternative to fiat currencies
(Chen, 2024). However, their values fluctuate rapidly, making them unreliable for reserve
currencies and everyday use (Edwards, 2025). As long-term stability is very important for
foreign reserve currencies, the USD seems the superior choice.
Stablecoins are a type of digital currency that is backed by assets, often backed by the US
dollar, which maintains the stability of the currency’s price (eToro, 2026). Additionally,
stablecoins can be traded between countries. However, as Stablecoins rely on the USD,
they are unable to replace the USD. Instead, they increase the dependence on the USD; it
remains the world’s main foreign reserve currency.
A central bank digital currency (CBDC) is a digital version of fiat currencies. This allows
central banks to use the money. An example of this could be Nigeria’s e-Naira, which was
released to simplify cross-border transactions (enaira.gov.ng). Unlike Nigeria, the US have
not released a digital version of the dollar. Unlike some cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are fully
centralised and controlled by the government and large banks (Bank of England, 2023).
One argument for digital currency replacing the USD as the world’s reserve currency is that
there are geopolitical tensions between nations, as the dollar is the most dominant currency,
so the US has significant influence over global financial markets (J.P.Morgan, 2024). As
many countries want to reach a more neutral monetary system that no single bank or
country can easily manipulate, the demand for digital currencies is starting to increase
(Digital & Analogue Partners, 2025). Therefore, the reliance on the USD may gradually
decrease.
Beyond politics, digital currencies offer many logistical advantages over the USD. Some
advantages may include lower transnational costs and greater accessibility across different
countries (Natwest.com, 2023). These benefits may encourage countries to invest more in
cryptocurrencies and other forms of digital currencies rather than the USD. Some financial
analysts speculate that in the future, as cryptocurrencies and other CBDCs become more
popular, the use of fiat currencies could be significantly reduced. Even though this may not
be in the foreseeable future, it remains a plausible long-term possibility (Team, 2025).
Despite growing adoption, digital currencies have significant obstacles to overtake the USD
as the world’s primary reserve currency. One drawback is that digital currencies, such as
cryptocurrencies, are very volatile. For example, in early 2021, when Bitcoin exploded by
more than x5 in less than 4 months (Edwards, 2025), this demonstrates extreme price
fluctuations, which have made many investors uncertain. Reserve currencies must hold a
stable value for them to be considered a suitable replacement for the USD, as central banks
would need them to set accurate and stable exchange rates to manage inflation and combat
financial crises (Bank of England 2020).
Another limitation of digital currencies could be that their success depends on how liquid the
financial markets are, or if they are backed by strong institutions such as government
treasuries (Conway, 2024). The US Treasury, the largest and most trusted bond market
globally, explains why the USD is so dominant. Treasuries are very reputable as they have a
long history of repaying debts on time, and they give investors strong legal protections,
encouraging them to invest in the USD as it’s a “safe” reserve asset (Conway, 2024), so
central banks hold US dollar reserves as it is an investment in a stable economy. Inversely,
decentralised currencies like cryptocurrencies lack government backing, so they do not have
consistent regulations to protect investors from market volatility (Team, 2025).
Commodities such as gold and oil prices are often priced in dollars because SWIFT (an
international payment system) is based heavily on the dollar (Best, 2025). A cycle is created,
as the more the dollar is used, the more dominant it becomes. Consequently, digital
currencies have little prospect of overtaking the USD as the main global reserve currency
(J.P.Morgan, 2024). Replacing the whole reserve currency system would require compliance
between every country and is extremely complex to implement (Milliken, 2025).
Data suggests that digital currency is unlikely to replace the USD as the global reserve
currency, although it’s considered the latest technological advancement (Arslanalp,
Eichengreen & Simpson-Bell, 2024). The dollar was able to maintain its dominance due to
being used consistently, having high liquidity markets, and strong institutional support from
the government (Federal Reserve, 2025).
However, there may be a need for digital currencies as they can be used to improve
international transactions, making them more efficient. Which may be the reason why many
countries may see that digital currencies are the future of the global reserve (Natwest.com,
2023).
To conclude, digital currencies challenge certain aspects of the dollar's hegemony. But I think
that they are more likely to exist alongside the USD rather than overtake it (Ox.ac.uk, 2025).
A global shift in the monetary system would be slow, and without robust institutional rules
and regulations that can protect investors, investment in these digital currencies may falter
(Bank of England 2023). Therefore, it remains clear that digital currencies will not dethrone
the US dollar.</p>
